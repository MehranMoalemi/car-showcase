# Car Showcase Project

Hey there, fully skilled Google engineer! ðŸ˜‰ 

This is a test project created with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Headless UI to show you my coding style. The APIs might not work since the trial may have ended, so take it easy!

## Features

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **Headless UI** for accessible, unstyled components.

## Note

Currently using simple `fetch` for data fetching, not RTK Query (maybe later).

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehranMoalemi/car-showcase.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Add your API key in .env.local:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RAPID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
4. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to see the project.


## Usage
Filter cars by manufacturer and model. The URL updates with search parameters, and results are fetched accordingly.

Thanks for checking out my project! Take it easy and happy coding! ðŸ˜„
